# Sales-Dashboard

This repository contains a small synthetic sales dataset (`Data.csv`) used for a data-cleaning / preprocessing exercise. The dataset is synthetic and was generated by ChatGPT.

## Project overview

The goal of this project is to prepare a clean, analysis-ready sales dataset by performing basic data cleaning operations: removing nulls and error rows, removing duplicates, splitting combined columns into atomic fields, and renaming columns for clarity. Additionally, a dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends from the cleaned dataset.

This repository currently contains:

- `Data.csv` — the synthetic sales data (raw).
- `README.md` — this file describing the dataset, preprocessing steps, and dashboard.

## Preprocessing steps performed

The following steps were performed on the dataset (in this order):

1) Removed Nulls — rows containing null values in required fields were dropped.
2) Removed Errors — rows with parsing/conversion errors (for example non-numeric values in numeric columns, or invalid datetimes) were removed.
3) Delete Duplicates — exact duplicate rows were removed.
4) Split Columns — `Order DateTime` was split into `Order Date` and `Order Time`.
5) Split Columns — `Customer Full Name` was split into `Customer First Name` and `Customer Last Name`.
6) Renamed Split Columns — columns created during splitting were renamed for consistency and clarity.

These steps were applied to produce a cleaned dataset suitable for aggregation, visualization, and reporting.

## Schema — before and after

Example columns you may find in `Data.csv` (original/raw):

- Order ID
- Order DateTime
- Customer Full Name
- Product
- Quantity
- Price
- Country
- ... (other fields)

After cleaning (representative schema):

- Order ID
- Order Date          # extracted from Order DateTime (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Order Time          # extracted from Order DateTime (HH:MM:SS)
- Customer First Name
- Customer Last Name
- Product
- Quantity            # numeric
- Price               # numeric
- Country
- ...

Note: Column names shown above reflect the renaming and splitting that was applied.

## How the cleaning was done (Power Query example)

The data cleaning steps were performed using Power BI's Power Query Editor. Below is a high-level description of how each step was implemented:

1) **Removed Nulls**: Used the "Remove Rows" > "Remove Blank Rows" feature to drop rows with null values in required fields (e.g., `Order ID`, `Order DateTime`, `Customer Full Name`).

2) **Removed Errors**: Applied data type transformations to ensure numeric columns (e.g., `Quantity`, `Price`) and datetime columns (`Order DateTime`) were valid. Rows with errors during these transformations were removed using the "Remove Errors" option.

3) **Delete Duplicates**: Used the "Remove Duplicates" feature to eliminate exact duplicate rows.

4) **Split Columns**: Split the `Order DateTime` column into `Order Date` and `Order Time` using the "Split Column" > "By Delimiter" option. The delimiter was set to a space to separate the date and time components.

5) **Split Columns**: Split the `Customer Full Name` column into `Customer First Name` and `Customer Last Name` using the "Split Column" > "By Delimiter" option. The delimiter was set to a space, splitting on the first occurrence.

6) **Renamed Split Columns**: Renamed the newly created columns (`Order Date`, `Order Time`, `Customer First Name`, `Customer Last Name`) for clarity and consistency using the "Rename Columns" feature.

After completing these steps, the cleaned dataset was exported as a new file (`Data_cleaned.csv`) for further analysis.

## Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends from the cleaned dataset. The dashboard includes the following features:

- **Total Profits KPI**: A key performance indicator displaying the total profits.
- **Sum of Sales KPI**: A key performance indicator showing the total sales.
- **Sum of Cost by Product**: A bar chart visualizing the total cost for each product.
- **Sum of Sales by Region**: A pie chart illustrating the distribution of sales across different regions.
- **Profit by Month**: A line chart showing the monthly profit trends over time.
- **Order Date Slicer**: An interactive slicer to filter the visuals by order date.

The dashboard provides an interactive and user-friendly way to explore the cleaned data and gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

## Assumptions and notes

- The data is synthetic and generated by ChatGPT. It is not production data and may include intentionally simple or inconsistent patterns used for demonstration.
- The cleaning steps above were chosen for simplicity and typical ETL needs. Customize validation rules to match your real data quality expectations.
- If some rows were removed because of parsing errors, consider logging them to a separate file (`Data_errors.csv`) for review before permanent deletion.
